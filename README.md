## 🌐 Internationalization (i18n)

The portfolio supports **English and Spanish** out of the box.

* Default language: **Spanish**
* English route: `/en`

Translations are handled via a shared `common.json` namespace:

```txt
public/locales/
 ├─ en/common.json
 └─ es/common.json
```

Language switching is available directly from the header.

## 📊 Case Studies Approach

Each project is presented as a **case study**, highlighting:

* **Problem** – the real-world challenge
* **Solution** – technical and architectural decisions
* **Result** – business or functional impact
* **Tech stack** – technologies used

This structure is designed to communicate value clearly to **non-technical stakeholders** as well as engineers.
